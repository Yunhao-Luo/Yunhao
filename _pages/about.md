Hi, I am Yunhao, currenlty a master's student in Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara, advised by [Prof. Misha Sra](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/misha-sra) and [Prof. Tobias HÃ¶llerer](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~holl/).

My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), eXtended Reality (XR), and Human-AI Interaction.

I am interested in designing interactive computing systems that augment human capabilities through adaptive interface, seamless multimodal interactions, and effective collaboration with intellegient assistants.
