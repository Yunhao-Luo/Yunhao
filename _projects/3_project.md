This is an attempt to visualize convolution in AR. Poker cards serve as platforms for showcasing the 3D representation of 3x3 RGB windows, a kernel, and the resulting output. The goal is to facilitate a better understanding of each component in the convolution process within image processing, with a particular focus on the representation of RGB channels that can be challenging to convey in 2D space.
