This project is inspired by **Stanford Smallville**.

According to Park et al, generative agents are computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior, which includes planning. Therefore, I made an attempt to utilize this ability of generative models like GPT4 to help people organize their agenda.

This app features a calendar which allows users to add and delete events. Upon adding a new event, a summary of the schedule will be analyzed by GPT, which will then insert some new events based on the existing ones to provide a more detailed schedule. Users can also further engage with the assistant by sharing insights about their schedule or expressing their preferences, enabling the assistant to incorporate higher-quality events into the schedule.
