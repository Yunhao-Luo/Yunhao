This is a no player game invented by John Horton Conway in 1970. Once the board's initial state is determined, the game can start its "evolution." One fascinating fact about this game is that it is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine. More information about the game at [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

Players can set the initial board by clicking on cells. Then start the game by clicking the start button. The repo below contains more detailed information on how to play and a demo.

This project is develped mainly using Tkinter.  **Source Code** at [game_of_life](https://github.com/Yunhao-Luo/game_of_life)
